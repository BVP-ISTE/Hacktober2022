#Input a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

#An input string is valid if:

#Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
#Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
#Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

#My solution:
