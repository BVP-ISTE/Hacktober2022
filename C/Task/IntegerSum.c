//Given a positive integer N. How many ordered pairs of positive integers (i, j) exist such that i + j = N.

//Note that since the pairs are ordered, (1, 2) and (2,1) are considered different.

//Input Format
//The first and only line of input contains a single integer N.

//Output Format
//Print a single integer, the number of ordered pairs of positive integers (i,j) such that i + j = N.

//Sample:
//Input: 1
//Output: 2
